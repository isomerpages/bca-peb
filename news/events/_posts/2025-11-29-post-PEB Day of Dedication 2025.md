<p>The Professional Engineers Board (PEB)'s Day of Dedication 2025, themed
"A Future Ready Profession," took place on 21 November at One Farrer Hotel.
Over 340 attendees, including 88 newly minted Professional Engineers (PEs),
11 Specialist PEs, and 6 ASEAN Chartered PEs, gathered to celebrate the
achievements and commitments of the engineering community in advancing
Singapore's built environment. The atmosphere reflected a strong sense
of pride and commitment to the engineering profession.</p>
<h4><strong>Opening Address by Guest-of-Honour</strong></h4>

<p>Minister Ms Indranee Rajah highlighted that Singapore's future is inextricably
linked with the future of engineering, which hinges on our engineering
capabilities. To achieve these ambitious goals, we will need not just PEs
but PEs who can accomplish the extraordinary. She emphasised that enhanced
internship programmes with longer periods, dedicated mentorship, and higher
salaries strengthen talent development. She noted that expanded qualification
pathways and strategic leadership courses will enhance the profession,
while streamlined regulatory processes enable engineers to focus on essential
skills development for national progress.</p>
<p>Minister Ms Indranee Rajah concluded with advice that Professional Engineers
are distinguished by their ability to say "no" to clients when requests
compromise safety, integrity, or ethics. Unlike other service providers,
professionals can refuse inappropriate requests based on their expertise
and values. This defines professionalism and commands respect.</p>

<p>Er. Lim Peng Hong, President of PEB, highlighted two key principles guiding
the engineering profession: Professionalism and Respect (PR), where engineers
must articulate ideas professionally based on engineering knowledge to
earn respect from developers, architects, contractors, and authorities;
and Innovation and Talents (IT), emphasising the need to retain talented
engineers by encouraging innovation rather than rigid rule adherence. Engineers
create what has never been, requiring industry support for creative solutions.

<p>The ceremony honoured Er. Yiong Hoi Liong as this year's Innovative Professional
Engineer Award recipient, exemplifying engineering excellence and creative
problem-solving. His groundbreaking innovation for CapitaSky marked a milestone
in sustainable construction as Singapore's first commercial redevelopment
project to achieve 100% reuse of existing bored piles. This engineering
feat saved 8,400 tonnes of concrete, resulting in a 37% reduction in carbon
emissions and demonstrating exceptional environmental stewardship.</p>
<h4><strong>Honouring our ASEAN Engineer Excellence Award 2025 Recipient</strong></h4>

<p>The ceremony also honoured Er. Emily Tan as the recipient of the inaugural
ASEAN Engineer Excellence Award. A trailblazer in Traffic and Transport
Engineering, she has served and contributed to both PEB and the Board of
Architects, as well as local and regional engineering bodies. As the founding
President of the Association of Women in Construction Singapore, she and
her team have supported and inspired many young female engineers in the
built environment sector.</p>
