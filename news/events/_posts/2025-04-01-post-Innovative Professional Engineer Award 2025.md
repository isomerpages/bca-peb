<p>The Board would like to invite you to nominate deserving fellow professional
engineers as candidates for the Innovative Professional Engineer Award
2025.</p>
<p>The Innovative Professional Engineer Award would be given to a professional
engineer who exemplifies professionalism through innovativeness and/or
entrepreneurship in delivering the outcomes of the projects that he or
she has personally been involved with and raises the standing and reputation
of the profession. The award is held once every two years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our recipients for the Innovative Professional Engineer Award 2023
are Er. Wong Seng and Er. Ng Choon Yeang. &nbsp;Er. Wong innovated and
patented the concrete PPVC technology using a unique composite shear wall
system which has brought significant cost savings and improvement in construction
productivity and sustainability.&nbsp; The lightweight PPVC modules lead
to more efficient transportation and installation, better site safety and
environmental outcomes for the industry.&nbsp; Er. Ng, on the other hand,
spearheaded studies, testing and implementation of Steel Fibre Reinforced
Concrete (SFRC) in Singapore for the first time in underground tunnels
for Downtown Line 3.&nbsp; The use of SFRC leads to enhanced productivity
and improved durability of the tunnels.&nbsp; The success of the project
prompted the extensive use of SFRC in subsequent MRT tunnelling works such
as the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) and Cross Island Line (CRL).</p>
