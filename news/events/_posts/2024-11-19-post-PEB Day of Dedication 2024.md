<p>Minister of State Dr. Faishal Ibrahim, highlighted engineers’ critical
role in supporting Singapore’s sustainable development and decarbonization
efforts under initiatives like the “80-80-80 by 2030” Green Building Masterplan.
He emphasised the importance of innovative practices, from AI-powered building
inspections to renewable energy projects like floating solar farms. Dr.
Faishal noted that engineers drive progress in resilience, efficiency,
and sustainability, crucial for Singapore’s future growth.</p>

<p>Er. Lim Peng Hong, President of PEB, emphasised on retaining talented
engineers by fostering innovation. Talented engineers seek to propose new
ideas and push beyond just complying with regulations; hence, the industry
must support and encourage innovation rather than impede it with rigid
compliance requirements. Er. Lim further emphasised that by allowing room
for innovative approaches, the profession can retain skilled engineers
and continue advancing with creative solutions while balancing public safety
considerations.

<h4>Celebrating our Esteemed Professional Engineers</h4>
<p>The ceremony recognised Er. Chua Chong Kheng and Er. Tan Ngo Chiaw as
Distinguished Engineers who have dedicated decades to advancing Singapore’s
infrastructure. Er. Chua, with 39 years in the land transport sector, played
a pivotal role in delivering key projects like the Circle Line and Northeast
Line, and led innovations like the region’s first rail testing center.
Er. Tan, with 30 years in water resource management, was instrumental in
projects like the Changi Wastewater Reclamation Plant and developed award-winning
technologies for water treatment. Both have contributed significantly to
Singapore’s engineering landscape and international reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Er. Chua Chong Kheng dedicated 39 years to Singapore’s land transport
system.&nbsp;He has been instrumental in LTA’s successful delivery of the
rail network consisting of the Circle Line (CCL), Downtown Line (DTL) and
Thomson East-Coast Line (TEL).</p>
<p>Er. Chua played a pivotal role in the successful launch of the world’s
first driverless and fully automated heavy metro system for the North-East
Line.&nbsp; Er. Chua led many groundbreaking initiatives, including the
world’s first integrated stacked rail depot for 3 rail lines (EWL, DTL
and TEL) and bus depot. He conceptualised and developed the Singapore Rail
Testing Centre (SRTC), the first of its kind in the region for rail system
testing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Er. Chua also made significant contribution to education and community
service, serving as Chairman of the SIT Industry Advisory Committee on
Sustainable Infrastructure Engineering and in NUS Civil Engineering Department
Advisory Board.&nbsp; He also served the local community as Chairman to
the Whampoa Citizens Consultative Committee.</p>

<p>Er. Tan Ngo Chiaw dedicated nearly 3 decades to engineering, design, supervision
and management of major water projects for PUB’s Four National Taps.&nbsp;
He has contributed towards the enhancement of Singapore’s water security
and resilience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Er. Tan led and worked with the project teams and stakeholders to adopt
the best technologies to these ground-breaking projects across the entire
water cycle.&nbsp; Among the projects are the Changi Waste Water Reclamation
Plant (CWRP), acclaimed as one of the largest and most advanced water reclamation
facilities in the world, the Deep Water Sewerage System (DTSS), the Choa
Chua Kang Waterworks upgrading project which was named the Water Project
of the Year at the Global Water Awards 2020 and integrating soil bio-engineering
with landscape architecture for the ABC Waters at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.</p>
<p>Er. Tan also made significant contribution to education, serving in the
NUS Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering Department Consultative Committee
from 2010 to 2019 and the Singapore Water Association from 2012 to 2019.</p>
<h4>Presentation on Coastal Protection</h4>
<p>Mr Ho Chai Teck, Deputy Director of the Coastal Protection Department
from Public Utilities Board (PUB) gave a very refreshing and insightful
presentation on the exciting future coastal adaptation plans to protect
and redevelop our coastal areas.&nbsp; He shared more of the upcoming engineering
works and how our engineers can be part of this exciting journey.&nbsp;
The insightful presentation sparked much interest, especially among our
new PEs to pursue engineering knowledge in these emerging fields and to
participate in the coastal protection works in the future.</p>
