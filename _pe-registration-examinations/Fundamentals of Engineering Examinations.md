The Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (FEE) tests an applicant’s knowledge of fundamental engineering subjects in civil, electrical or mechanical engineering. A person may apply to sit for the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination after he has obtained an approved degree or qualification listed in the [Professional Engineers (Approved Qualifications) Notification 2009](/act-and-rules/) or has proper and recognised academic qualifications in engineering accepted by the Board.
