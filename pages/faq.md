### **FAQ**

The Professional Engineers Board registers professional engineers in the branches of civil, electrical and mechanical engineering. A person applying for registration as a professional engineer to the Professional Engineers Board is required to hold an approved degree or qualification listed in the Professional Engineers [Professional Engineers (Approved Qualifications) Notification 2009](/act-and-rules/) and acquired not less than four years of relevant practical experience. He is also required to sit and pass examinations prescribed by the Board. The applicant is required to sit and pass the [Fundamentals of Engineering Examination](/FEE/) and following that, to sit and pass the [Practice of Professional Engineering Examination](/PPE/). In addition, the applicant is required to attend an interview.

#### Common Queries on Qualifications

The qualifications approved by the Board for the purpose of registration as a professional engineer are listed in the [Professional Engineers (Approved Qualifications) Notification 2009](/act-and-rules/).

In general, the Board does not consider qualifications obtained from distance learning, twinning programs or programs that are not approved as meeting the prescribed requirements.

If an applicant's undergraduate engineering degree is not listed in the Notification, the Board may consider the application for registration if the degree is supplemented by a Master in the same branch of engineering from NTU or NUS; or a PhD degree in the same branch of engineering from an institution approved by PEB.

#### Common Queries on Examinations
