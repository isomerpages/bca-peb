The PE Act requires a registered professional engineer to comply with requirements relating to continuing professional development (CPD) as part of the criteria to renew his practising certificate. The objective of CPD for professional engineers is to reinforce the need for lifelong learning. It is also in line with the emerging global trend towards promoting and ensuring continuous learning by engineers and other professionals so as to maintain their competency.

A PE who wishes to renew his practicing certificate is required to obtain a minimum of 40 professional development units (PDUs) over a prescribed renewal qualifying period. The 40 PDUs shall comprise a minimum of 15 PDUs (20 PDUs for PC 2015 and thereafter) in structured activities, and the remainder can be obtained from either structured or unstructured activities. A structured activity refers to a course or activity that is qualified by PEB for PDUs while an unstructured activity refers to an activity that involves self-directed learning, reading, discussion or participation.

Before making applications online, a course organiser must register with PEB first. Upon approval of registration with PEB, the course organiser will be given an online account and a password to access the account. Course organiser can then make an online application for qualification of a CPD activity under [categories 1(a), (b) or (c)](/determinepdu/) of the PEB's CPD programme.
