<p>The PE Act requires a registered professional engineer to comply with
requirements relating to continuing professional development (CPD) as part
of the criteria to renew his practising certificate.&nbsp;The objective
of CPD for professional engineers is to reinforce the need for lifelong
learning. It is also in line with the emerging global trend towards promoting
and ensuring continuous learning by engineers and other professionals so
as to maintain their competency.</p>
<p>A PE who wishes to renew his practicing certificate is required to obtain
a minimum of 40 professional development units (PDUs) over a prescribed
renewal qualifying period. The 40 PDUs shall comprise a minimum of 15 PDUs
(20 PDUs for PC 2015 and thereafter) in structured activities, and the
remainder can be obtained from either structured or unstructured activities.
A structured activity refers to a course or activity that is qualified
by PEB for PDUs while an unstructured activity refers to an activity that
involves self-directed learning, reading, discussion or participation.</p>
<p>Before making applications online, a course organiser must register with
PEB first. Upon approval of registration with PEB, the course organiser
will be given an online account and a password to access the account. Course
organiser can then make an online application for qualification of a CPD
activity under&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.peb.gov.sg/determinepdu/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>categories 1(a), (b) or (c)</u></a>&nbsp;of
the PEBâ€™s CPD programme.</p>
