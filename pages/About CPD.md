<h2>CPD Activities</h2>
<p>CPD activities are activities which a PE chooses to participate in. As
a PE may be operating under circumstances which are unique to him, the
focus of the CPD activities is best left to each PE to decide. The principle
that applies is that the CPD activities chosen must be relevant to the
practice of individual PE.</p>
<p>The Board therefore allows each PE the flexibility to select from amongst
a broad range of activities. The range of activities in this CPD programme
is not intended to be inclusive but as a general guide. The activities
that would be relevant are those that will enable one to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Maintain, improve, or expand technical skills and knowledge;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep abreast of changing procedures and standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand and apply advances in technology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better serve the engineering profession, community and environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop communication and management skills; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broaden into related fields, such as those covering management, financial
or legal aspects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>There are two types of CPD activity:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Structured activity refers to an activity that has been qualified for
PDU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unstructured activity refers to an activity that involves self-directed
learning, reading, discussion or participation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The 40 PDUs shall comprise a minimum of 20 PDUs in structured activities
for PC 2015 and thereafter, and the remainder can be obtained from either
structured or unstructured activities. The PEB’s CPD Committee qualifies
structured activities such as formal study courses, conferences, workshops,
seminars and in-house training for the purpose of CPD programme.</p>
<h2><strong>Professional Development Units (PDU)</strong></h2>
<p>The unit of measure for effort spent in pursuing continuing professional
development is termed as Professional Development Units (PDUs). PDUs are
obtained from participation in CPD activities.</p>
<p>Contact hour refers to an attendance or involvement lasting one clock
hour of not less than 50 minutes; no PDU is awarded for activity/course
less than 50 minutes.</p>
<p>A PE is required to obtain a minimum of 40 PDUs over a qualifying period.
The 40 PDUs shall comprise a minimum of 20 PDUs in structured activities,
and the remainder can be obtained from either structured or unstructured
activities.</p>

<h2><strong>Qualifying For PDU</strong></h2>
<p>Course Organisers and training providers etc will apply to PEB to qualify
their courses/activities for PDU. In addition, a PE may also apply to qualify
courses/activities for PDU if it is conducted by an overseas course organizer
or if he is a trainer and wishes to obtain PDU under category 3 (if course
organizer has not already applied for qualification). In the same way,
a company which conducts in-house training may apply to PEB for its training
to be qualified for PDU.</p>
<h2><strong>Audit Process</strong></h2>
<p>The Board may conduct random audit of PEs and those selected will be asked
to produce documentary evidence of their CPD participation during a particular
period. The documentary evidence may take any one of the following forms:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Summary of diary records or a log showing the activities claimed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Course enrolment record</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receipts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificate of attendance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attendance list from course organiser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employer’s report or certification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statutory declaration</p>
</li>
</ul>
